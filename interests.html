    <h1>Interests</h1>

    <p class="paragraph">
    Outside of my academic work, I enjoy activities that help me broaden my perspective and
    maintain a balanced lifestyle. Firstly, I have a strong interest in reading, particularly books
    related to fashion, culture, history, travelling and personal development.</p>
    
    <p class="paragraph">
    Secondly, I also enjoy learning foreign languages, as it allows me to better understand different cultures 
    and ways of thinking. I can speak 3 languages: English (fluent), German (average) and Chinese (basic); 
    with Vietnamese is my mother-tongue.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">
    Thirdly, I love photography and I love flowers. My favorite flower is the magnolia, 
    because I adore the pride in its purple and pink hues as they sway in the last winter wind.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">
    Fourly, I love watching (historical) dramas with power struggles and intense challenges, 
    mixed with emotional conflict and companionship.</p>
